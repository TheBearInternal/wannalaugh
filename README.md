### How to:
[Get the binary(exe) from here](https://github.com/sakshatshinde/WannaLaugh)

Create a file called "key.txt"
Enter an arbitrary "key" into key.txt


Make a directory in your C:\Users[localUser] called nukeMe for demonstration purposes
Check if the path looks like this : C:\Users[localUser]\nukeMe


Place random files in there for testing purposes; ie: stock family photos and/fake banking information, fake sensitive data stored on a .txt document. 

### Use of steghide can enable file to be embedded into a file ie: .txt, .doc, .docx, .pdf, .xls, .mp3, .mp4, .jpg, .png, and more.



# Upon clicking on file
The files in the nukeMe folder would be encrypted. 
Then a window will pop up providing message to pay ransom, which you can close easily but after a few seconds will pop up again. 
Copy the key from the key.txt file in the root folder of the project and then click the first button.
Nothing will happen. Now click the second button right below the first button. 
This will exit the window. 
Check the files in the folder nukeMe they have been restored
